			<h2 epub:type="title">Note</h2>
			<p>This book would not probably have been written for some time to come, but for the kind invitation and the most friendly encouragement of the editor and the publishers of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">The Atlantic Monthly</i> to write it for serial publication in their magazine. I feel it a most pleasant duty to express here my very best thanks for the hospitality that was offered to me, and for the friendly pressure that was exercised to induce me to undertake this work. It was published in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">The Atlantic Monthly</i> (September, 1898, to September, 1899), under the title, “The Autobiography of a Revolutionist.” Preparing it now for publication in book form, I have added considerably to the original text in the parts dealing with my youth and my stay in Siberia, and especially in the Sixth Part, in which I have told the story of my life in Western Europe.</p>
